## The Value of Software

![business value]()

note:
- software does not have value by itself
- every line of code is liability (financial, legal, etc.)
- from the business standpoint, it's only valuable when it provides business value
- usually, lowering cost or increasing profit


## The Ideal

![triangle of project management]()

note:
- the ideal outcome for a business is that they can get valuable software that is
	- on time
	- on budget
	- with all the features


## The Reality

![sad face becuase of software development failure]()

note:
- reality:
	- schedules slip
	- budgets grow
	- poor quality (lacking features or more bugs)
- customers are unhappy, the developers are unhappy, and the business is unhappy


## The Solution!

![waterfall model](/slides/waterfall-model.svg) <!-- .element width="70%" -->

note: 
- inspired from manufaturing and applied it to software engineering.
- does reflect activites done during software development
- each step is meant to prevent re-work at the later steps

issues:
- improbably to prevent re-work upfront
- process becomes heavy due to failures
- heavy process slows down software delivery, which
	- increases budget
	- misses deadline
	- building incorrect features
- results in vicious cycle ("runaway-process")

### Individuals and interactions over processes and tools


### Working software over comprehensive documentation


### Customer collaboration over contract negotiation


### Responding to change over following a plan

## 12 Principles
- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
- Delivery working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference ot the shorter time scale.


- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. 
- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.


- Working software is the primary measure of progress.
- Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.


- Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential.
- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to bcome more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
